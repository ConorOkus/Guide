# Restoring a wallet from a backup

There are a number of reasons why a user might need to recover their wallet. There are also a number of ways that this can be done.

## Restore from an automatic cloud backup

As outlined earlier in the chapter, we recommend an automatic cloud backup for first-time users. One of the major UX benefits of this is a seamless recovery process. All they need to do is log into their Google or Apple account.

If they aren't logged in, they only need to enter their password before the wallet can automatically access the recovery phrase stored on the user's iCloud or Google Drive account. Once the recovery phrase is located, the wallet can begin to regenerate the keys required for the user to access their funds.

## Restore with recovery phrase

First-time users of your bitcoin wallet may also have created other wallets with different providers. If this is the case, they can transfer that wallet into yours by entering their 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. There are several ways you can choose to allow a user to enter a recovery phase. These were outlined earlier in “ways to show” a recovery phrase section of this chapter.
