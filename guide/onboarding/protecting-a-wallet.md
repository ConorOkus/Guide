# Protecting a wallet

Bitcoin wallets contain sensitive information such as recovery phrases, balances, transaction histories, and more. Therefore it is crucial to add extra layers of security to keep private data out of bad actors' hands. Additional protection may also be necessary for users who share devices, such as parents with children.

A common practice for wallets is to have a barrier (i.e. Touch ID, PINs, etc.) that must be unlocked to open a wallet application. Creating robust and challenging to crack passwords and PIN codes isn't something that everyone excels at. These can be avoided in favor of other methods such as:

## Touch ID / FaceID

Biometrics provide a convenient way to unlock an app. More importantly, they don’t require users to remember anything.

Users of Android and IOS mobile devices already have access to this technology. However, this should only be implemented after thoroughly relaying security and privacy implications to your wallet’s user.

## PIN

A PIN is one of the most common and traditional methods for securing a mobile application. This setup requires that users create a 4-6 digit PIN that must be entered when opening their wallet application. Although biometrics are convenient, a PIN-based approach will be supported by all devices and, therefore, more accessible.

A PIN can also be used to encrypt data within a wallet which makes any locally stored information on the device inaccessible.

Some users prefer this type of security because they can use the same or similar pin across multiple applications and devices. A PIN usually consists of four to six numbers as this provides a sufficient level of security.
