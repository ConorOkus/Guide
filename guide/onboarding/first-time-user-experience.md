# First time user experience

Wallets are among the first bitcoin products that new Bitcoin users interact with. In this section, we will consider what makes a successful wallet onboarding experience for this type of user. Because onboarding experiences may look different depending on what type of recovery scheme you use, this section lays out best practices for each.

# What is a bitcoin wallet?

First, bitcoin wallets are not analogous to their namesakes. Physical wallets are places to store physical currency, credit cards, IDs, and so on. Bitcoin wallets don't actually store bitcoin.

Instead, a bitcoin wallet contains the "private keys" to your bitcoin, the bitcoin is located on a network that contains a communally sustained public ledger with a record of everyone's transactions and balances (so think of bitcoin wallets more like keychains). Like regular keys on a keychain, these keys can be copied. For example, if you gave someone a copy of your house keys, they could get into your home. Likewise, if someone has a copy of your private key, they can access your funds. This makes private key management one of the most important considerations of any bitcoin owner.

There are a few different types of [wallets](https://bitcoin.design/guide/glossary/#wallet) that let you send, receive, and store bitcoin.

The wallet creation process is an excellent place to break things up into different activities, events, and tasks. For example, you might want to dedicate multiple screens to generate a recovery phrase and explain why it is essential.
